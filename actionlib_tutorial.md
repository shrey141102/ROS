Sure, I can guide you through the process of creating an actionlib server and client in ROS Noetic using the Fibonacci series as an example. Here are the steps:

**1. Create a Workspace:**
First, you need to create a workspace and a package to work in. You can do this using the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg actionlib_tutorials actionlib message_generation roscpp rospy std_msgs actionlib_msgs
```

**2. Define the Action:**
Next, you need to define the action. This is done in a `.action` file in the `action` directory of your package. The file for our Fibonacci action might look like this:
```bash
#goal definition
int32 order
---
#result definition
int32[] sequence
---
#feedback
int32[] sequence
```
You can create this file with the following commands:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/actionlib_tutorials
mkdir action
echo -e "int32 order\n---\nint32[] sequence\n---\nint32[] sequence" > action/Fibonacci.action
```

**3. Modify CMakeLists.txt and package.xml:**
You need to make sure that `actionlib_msgs` is a dependency in your `package.xml` and that your `CMakeLists.txt` is set up to generate messages from your `.action` file.

In `package.xml`, make sure these lines exist:
```xml
<build_depend>actionlib_msgs</build_depend>
<exec_depend>actionlib_msgs</exec_depend>
```

In `CMakeLists.txt`, make sure these lines exist:
```cmake
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  actionlib_msgs
)

add_action_files(
  DIRECTORY action
  FILES Fibonacci.action
)

generate_messages(
  DEPENDENCIES
  actionlib_msgs
)

catkin_package(
  CATKIN_DEPENDS actionlib_msgs
)
```

**4. Write the Action Server and Client:**
Next, you need to write the action server and client. This is a bit too long to include here, but you can find example code in the [ROS actionlib tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionServer%28GoalCallbackMethod%29).

**5. Build and Source Your Workspace:**
After you've written your action server and client, you can build your workspace with the following commands:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

**6. Run the Action Server and Client:**
Finally, you can run your action server and client. In one terminal, run the server:
```bash
rosrun actionlib_tutorials fibonacci_server
```
And in another terminal, run the client:
```bash
rosrun actionlib_tutorials fibonacci_client
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
